# Bank Lambda Simulator

Simulator for using with [Bank Lambda Adapter](https://github.com/bluecodecom/bank-lambda-adaptor). Implements OAuth flows and some very very basic implementation of PSD2 AISP and PISP endpoints.

This project was developed during a hackathon organized by European Central Bank. It is meant for demonstration and informational purposes only and **in no way intended to be a production ready system**.
